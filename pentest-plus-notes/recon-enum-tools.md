# OSINTframework.com
A comprehensive dir of tools and resourcesused for gathering info from publicly available sources.
- *Curated list of tools and resources to help you do your recon.*

### Organizes into categories to find the right tools:
- Search engines
- Social Media
- Public records
- Technical resources


# Maltego
- A powerful data mining tool that provides a /*graphical interface* for linking and visualizing relationships betwen different pieces of information.
- Useful to map people, companies, domains, and ip addresses. Built-in "transforms" that allow you to pull data from multiple sources. Allows you to visualize complex relationships. Uncovers connections that may have not been immediately apparent. Trace campaign back to source to understand the scope.

# SpiderFoot
- An *automated data gathering* recon tool that gathers a wide range of data about your target from over 100 public data sources. Footprinting, scans for open ports, can gather osint from social media, dns records and online databases. High customizable. Automates the recon process, comprensive results. Detailed reports of domains, ip addresses, and exposed services.

# recon-ng
```
recon-ng
```
brings you to the default workspace, brings tools together. Switch in syntax going between version 4 and 5. Tutorials online may not reflect these changes.
- To set up a workspace
```
workspaces list
```
```
workspaces create new-workspace
```
It will by default move you into your newly created workspace, or you can select
```
workspaces load new-workspace
```
You will need to install the modules you want, you may need API keys depending on what you are interfacing with.
```
marketplace install recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
```
You can search to validate it has been installed.
```
modules  search
```
To install all modules (but then you will need to get the API keys)
```
marketplace install all
```

```
modules load whois_pocs
```
Now you are inside the module!

Inside of recon-ng there is a database. To see the various tables that are being used:

```
db schema
```

To enter domains:
```
db insert domains
```
From there you will enter the requested data (domain/notes)

To verify:
```
show domains
```
```
run
```

To show all the contacts from the whois queries:
```
show contacts
```
You can verify if they are legitimate at email dossier. 


To check the commands for recon-ng
- ```
  help
  ```
  
# nslookup
- A network admin tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping

```
nslookup domain
```
-The non-authoritative answer that is not from domain owners server. 

- To query the mail server:

```
nslookup -query-mx domain
```
Interactive prompt command
```
nslookup
```
From here you can enter the domain, set type=mx

# dig
- Flexible tool for getting info from DNSname servers. More detailed for interrogating DNS name servers than nslookup.

```
dig domain
```
Options can allow you to check out the mail servers (mx records), +short (the ip addresses only), -x ip address (reverse lookup to see the domain name instead), +noall +answer

- 
  
# DNSdumpster
- free domain research tool that provides info about the DNS infra of a domain
- helps map out domain footprint by associating subdomains, ip addresses, and mx records; helps to id the dns landscape of a network
- ex. dev.domain.com might be a weaker on security than a prod environment, shows potential entry points
- clear visual rep
- potential misconfigs in DNS setup: old records, mail servers, open relays (smtp servers that are misconfigured that allows anyone to send email through them), and dns zone transfers

# amass
- open-source tool developed by OWASP for performing in-depth DNS enum and mapping out the external assets of a target
- uses various techniques including passive info gathering, active dns probing, and brute-forcing subdomains
- actively maintained and updated
- command line tool
- integratesover 80 data sources and APIs to collect info, which it then correlates and presents in an organized manner
- uncover hidden subdomains, map out domain relationships, identify ip addresses associated with target
- provides options for active recon: dns probing and brute-forcing
- techniques: reading ssl/tls certs, performing dns zone transfers, checking cert transparency logs, recursive subdomain discovery

- Subcommands can be used in conjunction, allowing to create scripts that perform multiple amass ops seamlessly
  
Discover target namespaces for enumerations
  ```
  amass intel
```
performing enum and network mapping
```
amass enum
```

Manipulate the amass graph db
```
amass db
```

ex. 
```
amass enum -passive -d owasp.org -src
```
collect info without actively probing


# Shodan
- Search enginefor internet-connected devices
- Indexes devices connected to the internet such as webcams, routers, servers, industrial control systems
- scans for publically accessible devices and provides details about configs and vulns
- ex. you can search shodan for a device running a specific version of a web server, can help pinpoint targets
- provides data on geographic location of devices, their ip addresses, metadata like device name and banner
- can create alerts (for specific ip ranges for example), usefulf for continuous monitoring

# Censys.io
- detailed intel to help orgs uncover risks and mitigate threats
- internet wide scanning, port threathunting, attack surface mgmt
- collects and indexes data about devices and their configs
- provides more detailed and structured data, helps to visualize
- complex queries to search all devices, operating systems, misconfigurations, exposed databases within targets IP range
- offers API access to integrate into tools/workflows


# tcpdump
- powerful cmd-line packet analyzer tool used for net traffic capture and analysis
- widely used by net admins and pentesters
- understand the comm patterns of a target network
- see what protocols are used, id the devices communicating on the network, detect potential vulns based on the traffic observed
- tcp,udp and other types of packets can be capped
- packet captures can see open ports, unencrypted comms, suspicious connections

capturing all traffic on a specific interface (-i is the network interface)
```
tcpdump -i eth0
```
capture packets from a specific host
```
tcpdump host example.com
```
traffic from specific port (this also creates the pcap file with the -w 
```
tcpdump port 80 -w capture.pcap
```
the packet capture can id vulns such as:
- insecure API endpoints
- unencrypted data transmissions
- improper session handling

- real-time monitoring

  
# Wireshark
Network analysis, helpful in recon and enum. Packet analyzer, captures and displays data traveling back and forth on a network in real-time.
Listens to traffic without actively engaging with the system, so it is passive recon.
- essential to dissect the layers of the OSI model from captured packets
Allow you to view details:
- Mac addresses
- IP addresses
- TCP/UDP ports (can see services on non-standard ports)
- Actual payload of the packets

- Captures smtp traffic, phishing attacks or helps you to understand the flow of communications

Wireshark is enum as it is a step beyond recon where a user actively engages with the target to extract more detailed info.

Can help to id anomolies and security mechanisms in place such as:
- WAFs
- Load balancers

# Wireless Analysis Tools
## Aircrack-ng
A comprehensive suite of tools designed for assessing the security of wireless networks. Captures traffic from wireless networks to analyze it.
ex. capture the 4 way handshake when a device connects to wpa or wpa2, you can use a dictionary attack to crack the wifi pw
It includes for:
- capturing packets
- analyzing them
- breaking wep, or wpa
- tools for de-authentication attacks (disconnect devices from the network forcing them to reconnect and potentially allowing the handshake needed to be captured so that you can crack the pw)

This process includes setting wireless adapter to monior mode to capture all traffic in the air. And then, using aircrack-ng to analyze and attempt to decrypt the data.

## InSSIDer
A wi-fi scanner that visualizes and analyzes wireless networks, optimize landscape
Provides details about the network such as:
- signal strength
- channel usage
- security settings
Particularly useful for identifying signal overlap and channel interference.
Identify all the wifi networks in a given location and see how they are distributed across different channels. Identifies points of interference or weak signal areas.

1. Scan the area and quickly identify all access points within range. Can detect rogue AP, that mimic legitiate naming convention.
2. Use InSSIDer to map the signal strength and coverage areasof authorized APs. Reveals that some areas suffer from poor quality, and modify the channel to increase robustness.

## WiGLE.net
A website and database that collects info about wireless networks from all over the world.
Users contribute data by mapping wifi networks.
Allows you to search by location, SSID and other criteria.

1. Gather info about wireless networks in the area, can help plan the approach during onsite assessments
2. Identify patterns in the deployment of wireless networks, such as common ssids and or default configs which might contain vulns
