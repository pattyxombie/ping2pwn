# OSINTframework.com
A comprehensive dir of tools and resourcesused for gathering info from publicly available sources.
- *Curated list of tools and resources to help you do your recon.*

### Organizes into categories to find the right tools:
- Search engines
- Social Media
- Public records
- Technical resources


# Maltego
- A powerful data mining tool that provides a /*graphical interface* for linking and visualizing relationships betwen different pieces of information.
- Useful to map people, companies, domains, and ip addresses. Built-in "transforms" that allow you to pull data from multiple sources. Allows you to visualize complex relationships. Uncovers connections that may have not been immediately apparent. Trace campaign back to source to understand the scope.

# SpiderFoot
- An *automated data gathering* recon tool that gathers a wide range of data about your target from over 100 public data sources. Footprinting, scans for open ports, can gather osint from social media, dns records and online databases. High customizable. Automates the recon process, comprensive results. Detailed reports of domains, ip addresses, and exposed services.

# recon-ng
```
recon-ng
```
brings you to the default workspace, brings tools together. Switch in syntax going between version 4 and 5. Tutorials online may not reflect these changes.
- To set up a workspace
```
workspaces list
```
```
workspaces create new-workspace
```
It will by default move you into your newly created workspace, or you can select
```
workspaces load new-workspace
```
You will need to install the modules you want, you may need API keys depending on what you are interfacing with.
```
marketplace install recon/domains-contacts/whois_pocs
```
You can search to validate it has been installed.
```
modules  search
```
To install all modules (but then you will need to get the API keys)
```
marketplace install all
```

```
modules load whois_pocs
```
Now you are inside the module!

Inside of recon-ng there is a database. To see the various tables that are being used:

```
db schema
```

To enter domains:
```
db insert domains
```
From there you will enter the requested data (domain/notes)

To verify:
```
show domains
```
```
run
```

To show all the contacts from the whois queries:
```
show contacts
```
You can verify if they are legitimate at email dossier. 


To check the commands for recon-ng
- ```
  help
  ```
  
# nslookup
- A network admin tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping

```
nslookup domain
```
-The non-authoritative answer that is not from domain owners server. 

- To query the mail server:

```
nslookup -query-mx domain
```
Interactive prompt command
```
nslookup
```
From here you can enter the domain, set type=mx

# dig
- Flexible tool for getting info from DNSname servers. More detailed for interrogating DNS name servers than nslookup.

```
dig domain
```
Options can allow you to check out the mail servers (mx records), +short (the ip addresses only), -x ip address (reverse lookup to see the domain name instead), +noall +answer

# DNSdumpster
- free domain research tool that provides info about the DNS infra of a domain
- helps map out domain footprint by associating subdomains, ip addresses, and mx records; helps to id the dns landscape of a network
- ex. dev.domain.com might be a weaker on security than a prod environment, shows potential entry points
- clear visual rep
- potential misconfigs in DNS setup: old records, mail servers, open relays (smtp servers that are misconfigured that allows anyone to send email through them), and dns zone transfers

# amass
- open-source tool developed by OWASP for performing in-depth DNS enum and mapping out the external assets of a target
- uses various techniques including passive info gathering, active dns probing, and brute-forcing subdomains
- actively maintained and updated
- command line tool
- integratesover 80 data sources and APIs to collect info, which it then correlates and presents in an organized manner
- uncover hidden subdomains, map out domain relationships, identify ip addresses associated with target
- provides options for active recon: dns probing and brute-forcing
- techniques: reading ssl/tls certs, performing dns zone transfers, checking cert transparency logs, recursive subdomain discovery

- Subcommands can be used in conjunction, allowing to create scripts that perform multiple amass ops seamlessly
  
Discover target namespaces for enumerations
  ```
  amass intel
```
performing enum and network mapping
```
amass enum
```

Manipulate the amass graph db
```
amass db
```

ex. 
```
amass enum -passive -d owasp.org -src
```
collect info without actively probing
