# Scripting
Essential for nt scanning, automating attacks, and meeting pentest goals.
Helps to be thorough and precise!

# Shells and Programming Languages

#### Script
- A list of cmds that are exe by a certain program or scripting engine. There are 6 on the exam.

Exam tips: read and understand 6 languages: bash, ps, ruby, python, perl, js. Read to understand what it is doing. Basic syntax.

## 1. Bash
A scripting language and command shell for unix-like systems that is default shell for Linux and macOS. Can also set it up on unix.
- supports elements such as variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and more

 Always starts with shebang `#!/bin/bash`. This is telling the computer this is written in bash.

 `echo` prints this to the screen. Benefit is to tell the user what is going on.

 ## 2. Powershell
 A scripting language and command shell for Windows exclusively
 Supports - variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, cmdlets that use a verb-noun syntax. Difference from bash is that cmdlets are used.

 ex. `Write-Host "Retrieiving Logon Failures"` verb-noun

`Get-EventLog -Newest 5 -LogName Security -InstanceId 4625 | select`

`timewritten, message | OutFile C:\logon-failures.txt`

`Write-Host "Completed"`
This is a search command for logon failures, and then select those entries, and lets you know when it is completed

###  WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line)
Program used to review log files ona  remote Windows machine

`wmic NTEVENT
WHERE "LogFile='Security'
AND "EventType=5" GET
SourceName, TimeGenerated, Message`

Selects all security type log entries whose events are type 5 (login failures)

## 3. Python and 4. Ruby
Interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming langauges used heavily in cybersecurity by analysts and pentesters because easy to write in, great at searching files, scripting languages so they go through line by line, they are not compiled, easy to read the source code

## 5. Perl
Another general purpose interpreted programming language that can be used as a scripting language like python and ruby. Created in 1980s as a general-purpose unix scripting language used for text manipulation. Perl was used on web servers for dynamic content generation. Practical, easy to use, efficient, a lot of third party modules.

## 6. JavaScript
A scripting langugage only that allows devs to do fancy and complex things on a webpage, popups, on click actions. Many versions such as ReactJS (front-end of the website) or NodeJS (Back-end of the website). A lot of webapp pentesting get familiar with js. Finding vulnerable js components.
