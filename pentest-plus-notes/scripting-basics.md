# Shells and Programming Languages

#### Script
- A list of cmds that are exe by a certain program or scripting engine. There are 6 on the exam.

Exam tips: read and understand 6 languages: bash, ps, ruby, python, perl, js. Read to understand what it is doing. Basic syntax.

## 1. Bash
A scripting language and command shell for unix-like systems that is default shell for Linux and macOS. Can also set it up on unix.
- supports elements such as variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and more

 Always starts with shebang `#!/bin/bash`. This is telling the computer this is written in bash.

 `echo` prints this to the screen. Benefit is to tell the user what is going on.

 ## 2. Powershell
 A scripting language and command shell for Windows exclusively
 Supports - variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, cmdlets that use a verb-noun syntax. Difference from bash is that cmdlets are used.

 ex. `Write-Host "Retrieiving Logon Failures"` verb-noun

`Get-EventLog -Newest 5 -LogName Security -InstanceId 4625 | select`

`timewritten, message | OutFile C:\logon-failures.txt`

`Write-Host "Completed"`
This is a search command for logon failures, and then select those entries, and lets you know when it is completed

###  WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-Line)
Program used to review log files ona  remote Windows machine

`wmic NTEVENT
WHERE "LogFile='Security'
AND "EventType=5" GET
SourceName, TimeGenerated, Message`

Selects all security type log entries whose events are type 5 (login failures)

## 3. Python and 4. Ruby
Interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming langauges used heavily in cybersecurity by analysts and pentesters because easy to write in, great at searching files, scripting languages so they go through line by line, they are not compiled, easy to read the source code

## 5. Perl
Another general purpose interpreted programming language that can be used as a scripting language like python and ruby. Created in 1980s as a general-purpose unix scripting language used for text manipulation. Perl was used on web servers for dynamic content generation. Practical, easy to use, efficient, a lot of third party modules.

## 6. JavaScript
A scripting langugage only that allows devs to do fancy and complex things on a webpage, popups, on click actions. Many versions such as ReactJS (front-end of the website) or NodeJS (Back-end of the website). A lot of webapp pentesting get familiar with js. Finding vulnerable js components. 

 
 # Variables
 Used to store values and data for different data types. 5 types.

 ## Integers
 A variable that stores an integer or a whole number that may be positive or negative, whole numbers. Can do mathematical equations with these. Cannot add an integer and decimal. 

 ## Float/Decimal/Real Number
 A variable that stores a decimal

 ## Booleans
 A form of data with only two possible values: true or false, depends on programming language but can even be delineated by a 1 or 0

 ## Character
 A variable that can only store ONE ASCII character, can be a number, letter, as long as it is an ASCII char. Just one. 

 ## Strings
 A variable that stores multiple char, but does not allow mathematical functions. Will need to put numbers into integers!

 Variables can change throughout the exe of a program. Program might initiate the variables with a starting value, ex. ` firstname = Xombie ` then in the program firstname is asked. It will then change it to whatever is inputted. 

 ## Constant
 Like a variable, but it cannotbe changed within the program once defined. Some things won't change during execution, like mathematical equations that contain pie. Pie will always be a constant.

 How do we define value of vairbables and constants?
 In most programming languages use an ` = `.

 # Loops
A type of flow control that controls which order the code will be exe in a given program. Ex. a piece of code 10 different times, logic takes over until it completes the 10 times. 3 types of loops:

## For loop
Used when the number of times to repeat a block of code is known. Simplest, ex. 
```
For i = 1 to 10
     OUTPUT(i)
Endfor
```
It will start with 1, and then go through the loop. Each time it will print to the screen the value of i.
Resulting in:
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
It then stops executing

## While loop
Used when the number of times to repeat a block of code is not known and will only stop until something happens.
Setup a condition, and the code tests for it at the beginning of the loop:

```
i = 0
While i < 10
     OUTPUT(i)
     i = i + 1
Endwhile
```
i is initially set to 0, so it will print out 1 as i. Once i = 10, the loop will not run.

## Do loop
Used when there's an indefinite iteration that needs to happen will only stop until some condition is met at the end of the loop. Testing condition at the end of the loop instead of the begining, we want to do this if we want to make sure the code always runs at least one time.

```
Do
     OUTPUT(i)
     i = i + 1
Unitl i > 10
```
if i = 50, it will still print it out at least once.

A more realstic example of a Do Loop:

```
Do
     OUTPUT(file.readLine)
Until file.endOfFile
```
It will print the file to the screen line by line, until it is at the end, then it stops.
